# Conference-Designer
=============

This is the Conference Designer sample for Obeo Designer. 

This sample is used for demo during conferences, with a customization with the current conference's program.

To install it, the easiest way is to download Obeo Designer Community Edition 7.0 which provides a ready-to-use bundle with Sirius 2. Just check out this source code, and use a runtime workspace to try the sample with these projects:
* fr.obeo.conference.design
* fr.obeo.conference.sample.*


Last change: 
* Upgrade to Sirius 2.0 (and OD 7.0.1)
* Representations with different ways to show the same information

The very next steps for this project are:
* upgrade to Sirius 3.0 
* migrate to AQL
